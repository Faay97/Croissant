      Made from layer upon layer of flakey pastry, loads of butter, and tasting
      like heaven, the croissant (pronounced “kwa-son”) is simply a thing of joy
      and wonder. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and,
      like other viennoiseries, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The
      dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating.
